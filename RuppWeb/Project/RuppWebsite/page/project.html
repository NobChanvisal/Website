              Cooperation between university and industry plays a crucial role
              for skill development, employment opportunities for graduate,
              innovation and technology transfer, and the promotion of
              entrepreneurship. The importance of cooperation between HEIs and
              their socio-economic environment is being addressed in Europe
              within the current 'Europe 2020 Strategy'.

              HR4Asia HR unit is progressed under Personnel Office to manage all
              staffs including full-time, part-time, official, and contracted
              staffs, and also evaluate staffs’ performance for promotion once
              staffs applied for. Human Resource Management is very important of
              each and every organization. Without Human Resource management and
              with only technical staffs, the outcomes/ result of the whole
              organization would not be satisfied enough. The Human Resource
              Management has to be in place in order to achieve maximizing
              output from effective and efficient HRM.

              The European project GEReSH-CAM aims to support Cambodian
              academics in shaping a policy of research and innovation in the
              social sciences and humanities in Cambodia. GEReSH-CAM project
              covers a period of three years, from october 2016 to October 2019
              and is supported by the Erasmus + program of the European Union.

              The project aims to integrate futures and sustainability thinking,
              promote innovation and entrepreneurship, build public-private
              partnerships and include innovative teaching methods. Associate
              partners from the national governments and civil society provide
              guidance on most relevant challenges and skills needed.

            <p>
              The wider objective is to ensure that the partner HEIs are able to
              respond to the capacity and employment needs of sustainable energy
              development in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The objective will have
              a direct link to strengthening the integration of sustainable
              energy goals into national level energy policies, provide
              qualified energy experts into the local, national and regional
              labor markets and foster greater collaboration between the
              traditionally siloed public and private sectors and increase
              regional level cooperation and mobility in research,
              entrepreneurship and innovation. The possible direct short term
              impacts include modernisation and internationalisation of HEIs,
              and in long term the project will contribute to sustainable energy
              policies, mitigation of climate GHG emissions and climate change,
              energy security and better access to energy for all.

              The Nodes of Excellence in (SEA) Universities through Spatial Data
              NEXUS project is an Erasmus + CBHE (Capacity Building in High
              Education) proposal whose main aim is to enhance the research
              capacities of HEIs in the southeast Asian region, by strengthening
              relationships between Education, Research and Innovation in GIS,
              SDI and remote sensing, for applications that are related to
              environment, agriculture and situations of emergency. The project
              will develop a common nexus between various actors of research and
              innovation (HEIs, research centers, spin-off companies) in
              Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia where specific methodologies for
              innovation transfer are convergent with EU developments in
              accordance with Europe 2020 strategy and Smart specialisation
              initiatives which is a new engine to boost R&D growth and
              subsequently job opportunities and business creation. This will
              improve the transfer of innovation from universities to local and
              regional enterprises, enhancing their innovation potential for
              geodata use and generating new applied research.

              Government public expenditure reduction is one of the many
              challenges that Cambodian Higher Education System is facing.
              Explosive growth in enrollment, difficulties to recruit and retain
              highly qualified staff and obsolete facilities also contribute to
              affect the quality of the education and therefore the increasing
              of graduate unemployment or under-employment.

              BALANCE consortium identified the improvement of the HEIs
              Financial Management as the key point to target in order to face
              the above mentioned challenges and satisfy the government demands.
              Indeed, Financial Management is the cornerstone of institutional
              management and quality education.

              For these ASIAN countries, the industrial structure of the economy
              is still at its beginning and is facing many challenges with their
              education system. One of them is the lack of expert education with
              corresponding skills to work on new technology of automation in
              processing and manufacturing system.
              <span class="fw-bolder"> ASEAN FACTORI 4.0 </span> project is
              proposed to contribute to this challenge by the design of a set of
              industrial automation labs with a corresponding staff training
              program to initiate the foundation of center of excellence in
              automation in each institute, different kinds of pedagogical
              process will be implemented to creative a network of competencies
              among our partner countries following their local needs and to
              permit cross learning approach during the project. Through the
              industrial 4.0 roadmap, the project is the first step to educate
              students to prepare a future generation of qualified workers able
              to implement advanced manufacturing and processing machinery.

              The educational curriculum seems to not successfully match with

              student-centered learning environment, cover successfully the
              needs of a growing diverse population of children in China, India
              and Cambodia with a variety of multi-cultural, multi- linguistics
              and multi-ability needs and respond to the gap in skills set in

              Media is an important stakeholder in regard to societies reaching
              the goals of development-both as a contributor and a beneficiary.
              Notwithstanding, the Communication and media studies curriculum in
              the Asian HEIs seem to not successfully match with the skills
              required for effective sustainable development reporting in order
              to delivery the 2030 Agenda. The new courses will respond to the
              need for modernization of curricula in journalism and media
              reporting in the PC-HEIs, the need for journalist education with
              focus on sustainable development as well as the need for strong
              journalistic and pluralistic media system and the process of
              sustainable development. The curriculum content is designed to
              install the skills and level of data literacy necessary to produce
              both short data stories on a deadline as well as longer in-depth
              stories that explain underlying development challenges facing the
              region through data and digital storytelling. By choosing what is
              in a story, how the story is told, and the diversity of stories,
              journalists and editors have the capacity to enhance or limit the
              information people will use to form opinions and make decisions.
              Specifically, the objective pursued is in department of Media and
              Communication of Faculty of Social Science and Humanities of RUPP.

              economic growth and innovation in the partner countries with their
              lack of capacities in green entrepreneurship as well as resolving
