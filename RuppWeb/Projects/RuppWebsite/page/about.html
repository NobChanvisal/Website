              <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), founded in 1960, has
                undergone a series of transformations to become the leading
                national university in Cambodia. Other transformations are still
                happening. In the last five years, for example, Rupp has made
                considerable progresses in many areas including organizational
                structure, institutional governance, capacity building,
                infrastructure development, research, teaching and learning,
                curriculum development, and quality assurance. These
                achievements have encouraged RUPP management and faculty to
                strive harder to implement the institutional reform and achieve
                development goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking towards the future, Rupp will grasp opportunities and
                assume a key role in driving Cambodia’s socio-economic
                development through the creation of human capital and the
                provision of quality research, training and community service.
                Rupp aspires to contribute to the achievement of the 2030 and
                2050 national development goals of the Royal Government of
                Cambodia as well as the higher education vision of the Ministry
                of Education, Youth, and Sport.
              </p>
              <p>
                Against this backdrop, this Strategic Plan 2019-2023 has been
                developed to guide Rupp in realizing its development vision and
                goals for the next five years. It will serve as a roadmap for
                the university to orient its focus and for its sub-units to
                devise their own action plans accordingly. The strategic plan
                will move Rupp closer to assuming its place among other national
                universities in the ASEAN region as a center for intellectual
                and cultural development.

                The Royal University of Phnom Penh first opened its doors as the
                Royal Khmer University on January 13, 1960, with a National
                Institute of Judicial and Economic Studies, a Royal School of
                Medicine, a National School of Commerce, a National Pedagogical
                Institute, a Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, and a
                Faculty of Science and Technology. The language of instruction
                during this period was French.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the establishment of the Khmer Republic, the Royal Khmer
                University became the Phnom Penh University. Between 1965 and
                1975 the university consisted of the Ecole Normale Supérieure,
                the Faculties of Letters and Humanities, Science, Pharmacy, Law
                and Economics, Medicine and Dentistry, Commerce, Pedagogy and
                the Language Institute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime forced the
                cessation of formal education. Schools and universities were
                closed and destroyed, and teaching services decimated. Along
                with all other educational institutions in Cambodia, Phnom Penh
                University ceased to function during this time. The Khmer Rouge
                targeted the educated, and many of the University’s faculty
                members were killed. Of the educated people who survived the
                regime, few chose to remain in Cambodia once its borders
                reopened. Deserted for almost five years, the campus became
                another victim of the grim period during the Pol Pot regime.

                In 1980, the Ecole Normale Supérieure reopened, again teaching
                predominantly in French. The following year saw the opening of
                the Institute of Foreign Languages (IFL), initially training
                students to become Vietnamese and Russian language teachers.
                Both colleges focused on training students to become teachers,
                thus rebuilding the education system within Cambodia.

                In 1988, the Ecole Normale Supérieure merged with the IFL to
                create Phnom Penh University. In 1996, the university underwent
                its final change of name, becoming the Royal University of Phnom
                Penh.

                During the past decade, the University has continued to grow and
                now includes the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Sciences
                and Humanities, and the Institute of Foreign Languages. New
                departments and degree programs are developed regularly to keep
                up with the changing needs of Cambodian society. In keeping with
                its commitment to higher education, RUPP began to develop
                postgraduate degrees at a Masters level since 2001.
