    <p style="font-size: 14px; color: slategrey">
      The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), founded in 1960, has undergone
      a series of transformations to become the leading national university in
      Cambodia. Other transformations are still happening. In the last five
      years, for example, Rupp has made considerable progresses in many areas
      including organizational structure, institutional governance, capacity
      building, infrastructure development, research, teaching and learning,
      curriculum development, and quality assurance. These achievements have
      encouraged RUPP management and faculty to strive harder to implement the
      institutional reform and achieve development goals. Looking towards the
      future, Rupp will grasp opportunities and assume a key role in driving
      Cambodia’s socio-economic development through the creation of human
      capital and the provision of quality research, training and community
      service. Rupp aspires to contribute to the achievement of the 2030 and
      2050 national development goals of the Royal Government of Cambodia as
      well as the higher education vision of the Ministry of Education, Youth,
      and Sport. Against this backdrop, this Strategic Plan 2019-2023 has been
      developed to guide Rupp in realizing its development vision and goals for
      the next five years. It will serve as a roadmap for the university to
      orient its focus and for its sub-units to devise their own action plans
      accordingly. The strategic plan will move Rupp closer to assuming its
      place among other national universities in the ASEAN region as a center
      for intellectual and cultural development.

    <p style="font-size: 14px; color: slategrey">
      The Royal University of Phnom Penh first opened its doors as the Royal
      Khmer University on January 13, 1960, with a National Institute of
      Judicial and Economic Studies, a Royal School of Medicine, a National
      School of Commerce, a National Pedagogical Institute, a Faculty of Letters
      and Human Sciences, and a Faculty of Science and Technology. The language
      of instruction during this period was French. With the establishment of
      the Khmer Republic, the Royal Khmer University became the Phnom Penh
      University. Between 1965 and 1975 the university consisted of the Ecole
      Normale Supérieure, the Faculties of Letters and Humanities, Science,
      Pharmacy, Law and Economics, Medicine and Dentistry, Commerce, Pedagogy
      and the Language Institute. Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime
      forced the cessation of formal education. Schools and universities were
      closed and destroyed, and teaching services decimated. Along with all
      other educational institutions in Cambodia, Phnom Penh University ceased
      to function during this time. The Khmer Rouge targeted the educated, and
      many of the University’s faculty members were killed. Of the educated
      people who survived the regime, few chose to remain in Cambodia once its
      borders reopened. Deserted for almost five years, the campus became
      another victim of the grim period during the Pol Pot regime. In 1980, the
      Ecole Normale Supérieure reopened, again teaching predominantly in French.
      The following year saw the opening of the Institute of Foreign Languages
      (IFL), initially training students to become Vietnamese and Russian
      language teachers. Both colleges focused on training students to become
      teachers, thus rebuilding the education system within Cambodia. In 1988,
      the Ecole Normale Supérieure merged with the IFL to create Phnom Penh
      University. In 1996, the university underwent its final change of name,
      becoming the Royal University of Phnom Penh. During the past decade, the
      University has continued to grow and now includes the Faculty of Science,
      Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, and the Institute of Foreign
      Languages. New departments and degree programs are developed regularly to
      keep up with the changing needs of Cambodian society. In keeping with its
      commitment to higher education, RUPP began to develop postgraduate degrees
      at a Masters level since 2001.
